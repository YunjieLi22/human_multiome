# A Human Fetal Cochlear Cell Atlas Reveals a Regulatory Blueprint for Spatial Patterning

## Preamable
- This directory contains illustration of the overall workflow of creating human fetal cochlear cell atlas
- Related codes illustrate the workflow of processing single-cell multiome, scRNA-seq and stereo-seq data
- Samples of the sequencing data were all from human cochleae out of PCW11, PCW14 and PCW16.
- All the scripts were runned on Linux and R.4.5.1, unless specially mentioned.
